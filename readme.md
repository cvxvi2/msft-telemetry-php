Using CobsNET, this is what has been identified and recreated:

settings-win.data.microsoft.com -- This receives data every time the 'settings' UWP app is loaded on Windows 10.

umwatson.events.data.microsoft.com -- Receives error codes

v10.events.data.microsoft.com -- noted in several areas but nothing received yet.


These domains were identified during a CobsNET lab test where the OS is fooled into thinking it has network connectivity. A *.microsoft.com SSL was used.
